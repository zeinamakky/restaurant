This is a very basic restaurant reservation app I created as an exercise for an interview. The premise is you can make reservations at this restaurant on the hour at every hour. Each reservation would be for an hour-long lunch or dinner.
The tables are set in place and won't be moved to accommodate larger parties.

There is a seed file for the tables. Run rake db:seed in the terminal to get those tables in.
Once that is done, you can add a new reservation and pick the number of seats you'll need. If no tables are available for your desired timeslot, you will be notified and asked to change your reservation.
